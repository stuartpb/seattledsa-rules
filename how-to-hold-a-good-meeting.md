# How To Hold A Good Meeting

Good meeting procedure is probably the most basic tool in the
organizer’s kit. It’s the most basic building block in any form of
collective action. With it a group of people can accomplish a lot
more than they could alone, more than the sum of their parts, if you
will. Without it, they can do very little, except burn themselves out
and reinforce the common beliefs that you can’t fight the powers
that be and that collective action is a bore consisting mostly of
endless meetings. Maybe that’s why they don’t teach it in school any
more.

The purpose of a meeting is decision-making. Decision-making has
several parts. The methods used must take care of each part.

---

## Decision-Making Dissected

First, there’s the **bright idea**. This comes out of discussion or out of
somebody’s head when they’re thinking, driving, trying to go to
sleep. We need to encourage the formation of bright ideas because
we need them. Have a place for unstructured discussion and
brainstorming. Bright ideas are very vulnerable when first born, so
don’t be tough on them. The time to challenge, criticize, amend,
argue against, point out unfeasibility—all these things come later. If
you jump all over the little baby ideas when they’re newly hatched
your chickens will stop laying them.

Next comes **discussion, maturation, clarification**. You’ve got a
cool idea, but will it work? How would we make it work? This is
discussion amongst friends, outside of the business meeting, before
the idea is proposed. Get it thought out well and be able to state it
clearly before taking it into the meeting to be proposed.

Next, our little idea, somewhat refined, is **proposed** in the meeting,
**discussed**, **amended**, and perhaps **passed** by the group. We’re
halfway there.

**Implementation** is next. Who’s going to do it? How? With what
money, equipment, support? By when? Maybe this is a committee
matter. The committee is instructed by the group to do such and
such, by this time, with these provisos, and to report back on such a
date. Or somebody volunteers to do it. Or a special committee is
called for, if it doesn’t fit into a standing committee.

**Accountability** is next. The committee or individual has agreed to
do it, by this date. The larger group needs to hear that the job has
been completed, or, if not, why not and when it will be done or what
needs to happen to get it done. This is the easiest part to let slip. If
you slack on this we’re all flakes in the eyes of the world, and in
actual fact, we can’t do diddly. We’re screwed.

The last part will, in some cases, be **review** and drawing
conclusions or lessons. The project didn’t really accomplish what
we wanted it to, and we think that’s because of this and this. We’ll
do this differently next time. Or, this thing worked really well,
because of this, so let’s remember to try to repeat these good
procedures. This is how we learn and advance.

It’s good to have a **record** of the action and the review and
conclusions written down so we don’t forget, and for the sake of
those brave comrades that come after us, so that they can learn
from our successes and mistakes. It’s good to share this stuff with
the rest of the union in other locals, so we can learn and advance
together.

OK, that’s what the meeting is for. Here’s how to do it. Yahoo!
Now we’re having some fun!

## What Makes A Good Meeting

There are a couple of general characteristics that all good meetings
share. One is that they are **short**. After about two hours people
become stupefied and quit retaining information. A diminishing rate
of return is reached that is easy to spot if you watch for it. People
get a glassy look in their eyes. Time to adjourn.

If the meetings frequently reach that point you start losing
membership, or at least the active participation of members.
Restructure your meetings, tighten up procedures, strengthen the
chair, schedule more frequent meetings, use more committees,
whatever you need to do, but don’t carry on with long meetings.
You’ll lose your best people, leaving the decision-making and
implementation to the dull-witted few who can stand to be bored and
have their time wasted. See the CP or SWP for examples of what
that will get you in the long run.

Good meetings are fairly civil. They are interesting. They have
relatively lively participation from most people present. They get a
lot of work done. They are efficient and move along quickly. They
are well-organized. They don’t wander off into subjects that don’t
concert the organization at that time.

The basic tools or parts of a good meeting include an agenda, a
chair, often a co-chair, a recording secretary, and most importantly a
rank & file that knows how to take part in a good meeting. That’s the
real key. If the R&F is passive and sheep-like then you’re just out of
luck. You’ll never do diddly squat and you may as well go home. If
the people in the meeting don’t really care about the business at
hand, there’s nothing you can do short of thinking up some business
they do care about, or finding out what they care about and doing
that instead. This falls under the heading of agenda. More on this
soon.

If they just don’t know how to do it, but are willing, you’re OK. A
strong chair can take the helm for a while, and institute a part of the
meeting that teaches the meeters how to meet. This is important
and needs to take a high priority.

## Teaching Meeters to Meet

There are two parts to teaching people how to hold a meeting. One
is to set aside a part of each meeting, ant the end, to briefly discuss
the meeting itself. People can speak up about how they felt and
what they wanted to have happen, what didn’t happen, how it was
too long and boring, and criticize the chair and each other. This is
touchy, but **some form of criticism is necessary to collective
action**, unless you are willing to have a boss who does it all for you.
Keep it impersonal, be gentle, understand each other as best you
can, and it can be a really good thing for the group. Try to work out
how the meeting or some part of the meeting could have been done
better.

The second part of teaching the meeters how to meet is to rotate the
chair. You do this for the obvious reason—that you need to have
more than one good chair in the group, and also for the purpose of
teaching the membership how to be in a meeting, how it really
works, how to be chaired.

**What you want is a whole room full of good chairs**, all just
chairing the crap out of themselves and each other and all keeping
an eye on the process and the big picture as well as taking part as
members. Then you’ve really got something. Then you really make
the chips fly. It’s a bit like the way waiters love to wait on other
waiters, because they know what’s going on, are sympathetic and
appreciative and help the process along. Ditto with the chair. It’s a
real joy to chair people who know how to chair.

If you’ve got an experienced chair, get him/her to chair a few
meetings to show how it’s done. Then start putting one brave soul
at a time in the hot seat with the experienced chair as co-chair to
step in as needed and guide the trainee. Keep the same trainee in
the chair for several consecutive meetings, until s/he is actually
getting the hang of it.

Keep it rotating slowly in this manner and eventually you’ll have a
group that’s a breeze to chair, and who can go out and do the same
thing elsewhere. We’re all leaders, right?

If nobody in the group really knows how to do it, then you all have to
learn together. Do this as a group project and give it the priority it
deserves. Train yourselves one or two at a time, not with a too-fast
rotation where nobody ever gets a chance to really get it down. It
takes time.

## Pick Your Process

The group has got to agree on a decision-making process. The
obvious choices are consensus and majority rule. Majority rule has
a bad rep amongst some people, but it gets the job done. If it’s
done right you’ll almost always have consensus anyhow, but you’ve
got a really functional system to go forward with when consensus
can’t be reached.

Consensus usually means long meetings with a lot talk that goes
way off the subject at hand. In my experience you can get a lot
fairer, more democratic and egalitarian process, in actual practice,
with majority rule, and get a lot more work done. Consensus is
more applicable to a house meeting, to a small group that lives
together and is really tight. With a more diverse group like an IWW
local, that actually has a lot of work to get done, majority rule is the
best bet. Consensus is also much easier than sabotage. I’ve seen
it done more than once.

## A Sample Meeting

You have to set a time and place and frequency for your meetings.
Call the first one, and put this on the first agenda. No time is good
for everybody. Do the best you can, and remember it can always be
changed. Get a place that’s quiet, private, and preferably doesn’t
belong to one of the members. That’s a possible power problem, so
avoid it if you can.

The first part of an **agenda** is the order of business. Take the one
from the IWW constitution for starters, and modify it if need be. It’s a
good one, tried and true. The chair prepares a proposed agenda,
leaving space for additions. The agenda has to be approved by vote
of the group, or else you’re already being led by the nose. Sort of
like the situation you meet in the voting booth.

## The Agenda, One Item At A Time

The chair should be chosen at the previous meeting, so as to be
able to prepare in advance. The chair gets there early, sets up
chairs for the membership, makes coffee or whatever, prepares a
proposed agenda big enough to be easily read by all, and greets
people as they arrive.

When it’s time to start the chair **calls the meeting to order**. I
recommend doing this at the exact moment the meeting was
scheduled for and let the latecomers be late. One of the most
important things in a good meeting is to avoid wasting people’s
precious time. Let the late ones be late and miss out (they can read
the minutes), and reward the prompt ones by not wasting their time.

**Choose a recording secretary**. This person takes the minutes.
The minutes should be clear, legible, and brief. They must include
motions made and whether or not they carried or not, how they are
to be implemented, by when and by whom. That’s the meat of it.
Also include time and place of the meeting, who chaired and
recorded, who was present. You can leave out the discussion on
questions usually. Get the bones and keep it clear and brief.

**Read the minutes from the previous meeting**. They should be
read in full and approved, or amended and then approved by vote of
the group. This way everybody has it clear what has been decided
and who said they would do what by when. That’s your jumping-off
point for the current meeting. It keeps you honest. It makes a
record of the life of the collectivity. It’s necessary for making the
next agenda. Don’t shortchange the minutes.

**Approve the agenda** or amend and approve. Make sure people
know they have a say in this. It’s more important than the average
newcomer realizes.

**Brief announcements and communications**. The key word here
is brief. These items require no discussion. If they generate agenda
items for new business, get them on the agenda and move on. You
can easily get mired down here, so watch it. They should be
relevant to the group, and if they are lengthy either have them in
written form for interested parties to read later or have people who
want details talk to the person later. Keep it rolling.

**Reports** also require no discussion, except for possible clarification.
If they generate business to be discussed and acted upon, they go
to new business or to the appropriate committee. Reports should be
kept brief, and can be presented in written form if they are long.
“I’ve got a report here from the doodad committee regarding current
innovations and the rising cost of gizmos. It’s long, so I’ll let you
read it after the meeting if you’re interested.” Reports include those
of officers, standing or special committees, delegates, attendees of
events or activities.

Also report on the implementation of previously made decisions of
the group. “We decided last meeting to poison the stream to murder
the neighbor’s dog. Bill and Nancy were in charge of
implementation on that one. Can we hear a report?” That sort of
thing.

Now we’re into the main meat of the meeting, the business. We
should have whizzed through everything up to here pretty quick (but
not so quick as to neglect), because now is when the going, of
necessity, gets a little slower.

**Business is anything that requires a decision and/or
implementation by the group.**

**Old business** was once new business, but we’re not done with it quite
yet. Maybe it got tabled ‘til we got more information. Maybe we
were too dingy to deal with it last meeting, but didn’t want to just
forget it. Maybe it was too hairy to handle all at once. Whatever
business wasn’t satisfactorily completed last meeting is now old
business, unless all we need is a report on implementation.

**A new business item is best presented as a motion**, though
sometimes you may need a few whereases to make it clear why you
are presenting the motion. The maker of the motion should have
taken the time to think it out pretty well, maybe kicked it around with
friends, and should have a pretty clear idea of what needs to
happen, thus saving us all a lot of time. “I move that we take off our
pants and sing Yankee Doodle on 14th Street, this Wednesday at
noon, and that a committee should be set up to help implement this
decision.”

There, now! That’s a nice clear way to bring up a new business
item. The chair says: “It has been moved that we blah, blah…”
restating the motion, both for the sake of the membership and to
help the recording secretary get it right in the minutes. The chair
says: “Is there a second?” If nobody seconds it then that’s that. It’s
not much of an idea and we can get on with the business. If one
more person wants it to pass, they second it, and it’s not totally out
of left field, and apparently worthy of our time. “Is there any
discussion?”

If it’s a shoo-in there doesn’t need to be much discussion. **We don’t
really need to hear three people say why they think it’s a good
idea if nobody disagrees**. The chair should direct the discussion
with this in mind. Ask if anybody wants to speak against the motion.
Ask if anybody is unclear on it or has hesitations or reservations
about it. Draw them out, to be sure it’s adequately discussed, but
ride hard on it to avoid waste of time. Keep the discussion to the
topic. The chair has to tactfully interrupt if somebody is wandering
off the track. Membership should also do this as needed. It’s a bit
tricky, but very learnable.

When it seems the question is clarified, adequately discussed, the
chair or any member can **call the question**, call for a vote. “All
opposed. All in favor.” If you think it’s a shoo-in, which is really
common in a well-functioning group, you can save a lot of time by
asking, after the motion has been seconded, if anyone’s opposed. If
not, it passes without the need for discussion.

When the motion passes, make sure to get it **implemented**. If it’s a
one or two person job, call for volunteers. If it’s a committee job
refer it to the appropriate committee or set one up. Make sure we
know who’s going to do it, by when, and when we’ll hear a report on
it. Make sure the recorder gets all that in the minutes. Move on to
the next item of business.

Often you’ll need a **break** to get through a two-hour meeting with a
clearheaded group. We usually take five or ten minutes between old
and new business. It’s best if people will move around, go outside,
make noise.

If there’s too much business and you see that you’re losing the
membership, see if there are items that can be **tabled**. You have to
ask the person whose item it is or the group about tabling
something. The chair can’t just do it without permission, but the
chair can suggest it.

The last item is **good and welfare**. This is a more general
discussion of things pertaining to the good and welfare of the group
and its members. It’s less structured, more touchy-feely, if you will.
It includes critique of the meeting and the chair, somebody needs a
place to live or a part for their car, somebody needs help or has
extra zucchinis, somebody has a general feeling about how the
group is doing, the direction it’s moving. Stuff that matters, but
doesn’t really fit into the motion-making-and-implementation mode.
It’s the community part and deserves time and attention.

Pick your next chair, agree on the next meeting time and place and
somebody can move to **adjourn**. No matter how good your
meetings get you’ll rarely hear anyone speak against a motion to
adjourn.

## Robert’s Rules Reduced

A few basic rules need to be in place to carry out the making and
passing of a motion. Robert’s Rules of Order are so complex that
they’re of little actual use, but the basic ideas are sound.

A **motion** can be made by any member at any time, having been
recognized by the chair. Any time there isn’t already a motion on
the floor, that is. If there’s a motion on the floor, that motion must be
dealt with before another motion can be made. Exceptions are a
motion to table or the suggestion of an amendment.

**Once a motion is on the floor, anything that doesn’t pertain
directly to that motion is out of order**, and must be cut off
promptly before the whole shooting match is sidetracked and
fuddled. You can come back to it later.

If an **amendment** is suggested it must be accepted by the maker of
the motion before it can be acted upon. Otherwise the original
motion has to be voted on before another motion, even an amended
version of the previous, can be made. Otherwise you get the
situation where some people are speaking to the original motion,
some to the amendment, and maybe some to a second or third
possible amendment. The result is a muddying and a loss of sense
of the meeting.

A ‘**point of order**’ is always in order. In other words, it can be made
at any time. You just say “point of order” and make your point. It
should either be for clarification of the motion at hand or clarification
of the process. Use it to point out that the speaker is not addressing
the business at hand, that the chair has overlooked some part of the
process, that people can’t hear what’s going on, something directly
related to the process, not the content, of the meeting.

“**Call the question**” is a common point of order. This means that
this discussion is going on too long, the ground has been covered,
that people are repeating themselves, and let’s vote on it now.

## Miscellaneous Words of Wisdom

The meeting isn’t really time for social stuff, hanging out with your
friends. It’s about business. The friend stuff is at least as important,
so give it its due. You may want to have a social hour before the
meeting or retire to a nearby pub afterwards to hang out and talk.

**Committees** are a good way to get work done and save time. If
something can be done in committee, don’t use up the time of the
whole body on it. The committees have to report back to the larger
group, but **you don’t need twenty people to decide where to get
a good price on paper clips** and who should pick them up.

Something an old Wobbly taught us (along with most of the rest of
this) is to **always conduct your meeting as if there were a
hundred people there, to be ready when the times comes when
there are a hundred people there**. Sound advice. For instance,
it’s a good idea to get people to stand up to speak. It helps us all
hear, and gives us all a little experience speaking to a group. Makes
it a lot easier when you have to stand up in front of a large group to
speak at a rally or something.

Good meeting procedure is something we all can learn. It’s not
that hard, and not that boring or unpleasant. In fact, when
compared to bad meeting procedure it’s downright fun and exciting.
A lot of groups start to fall apart or cease to be democratic when
they get past a dozen people, because they don’t make the jump
from the little group of friends that functions in a loose family style to
the larger-group ways of working.

Many of us have little or no experience with a functional and healthy
large democratic group, but such things do exist. The relearning
and development of the forms and ways of doing this large-group
democratic collective work is in an of itself a pretty subversive action
in the present social context.

Like it says in one old Wobbly cartoon:

> **Organize now! Organize right!**
